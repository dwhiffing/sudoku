Multiplayer sudoku
  idea 1:
    There are several sudoku boards available
    players pickup and put down each puzzle trying to get as many numbers as possible
    each number gets you a point
    getting a number wrong losses you 10 points

  idea 2:
    Each player solves the same puzzle
    when a player completes a house, the opponent is attacked in some fashion:
      numbers are switched to letters
      puzzle rotates constantly
      pencil marks are made invisible
